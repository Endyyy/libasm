# libasm 42

## About

`libasm` is a project from the 42 School curriculum where you will implement various basic functions from the standard C library using only assembly language. The goal of this project is to help you understand the inner workings of low-level programming, particularly how assembly language can be used to interact with the operating system and hardware directly.

## Project Requirements

- Implement the following C standard library functions in **x86-64 Assembly**:
  - `strlen`
  - `strcmp`
  - `strcpy`
  - `write`
  - `read`
  
- Your implementation should be efficient and avoid using C functions.
